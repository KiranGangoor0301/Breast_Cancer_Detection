## About the Project

The breast cancer prediction model uses the following libraries:

- SciPy
- Scikit-learn (sklearn)
- Google Colab
- NumPy
- pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Python (version X.X)
